# BlackJack Coding Project

The BlackJack Coding Project is a project I used to teach others at MAXX Potential how to code in Java. This covers beginner to intermediate Java code. 

## Prerequisites
You need to have java installed on your system. You can get the java from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

## Setup
#### To make sure that Windows can find the Java compiler and interpreter:
Right-Click This PC -> Properties -> Advanced system settings -> Environment Variables -> System variables -> PATH.

Add C:\Program Files\Java\jdk(your version)\bin; to the beginning of the PATH variable.

Click OK.

## Usage
Open the command-prompt and cd to the appropiate folder that contains the files from the "BlackJackGame-Start" folder. 

###### To Compile the java file in the command prompt
```bash
javac BlackJackGame.java 
```
###### To Run the java file in the command prompt
```bash
java BlackJackGame
```
