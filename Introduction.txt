During my time with MAXX Potential, we had something called “Undiscovered” classes. These classes gave the employees the opportunity to teach a class on a subject of their choosing. The rest of the employees were able to attend these classes to improve their knowledge in that particular area. I taught a class in the Java programming language. This teaches the employees how to make a simple blackjack game. It helps teach beginner to intermediate Java. The employees began with downloading a base runnable Java file and building from there. At the end of each Module, your file should be runnable. If there are any errors, then something was done wrong during that Module.
